  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    This is a full Legendary co-op run of Halo Wars: Definitive Edition. The walkthrough focuses on clearing every mission while collecting skulls and black boxes, with practical commentary on unit choices, base defense, and mission pacing.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Game Feel and Design Notes</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Halo Wars 1 nails the authentic Halo atmosphere better than its sequel—it has a grittier, darker palette that feels more like a war game</li>
    <li>The menu system mirrors Halo 3's design, and the limited edition originally included a Halo 3 map pack and the Flame Warthog</li>
    <li>Buildings are delivered by large drop ships that split apart and weld together—a cooler visual than the Condor drops in Halo Wars 2</li>
    <li>The developers (Ensemble Studios) made Age of Empires 3 before this, which is why the games share DNA—Age fans will feel at home here</li>
    <li>Rebel base assets appear in multiplayer, tying into the lore that Spartans were originally made for the insurrection, not the Covenant</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Campaign Flow</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>The run starts on Harvest with fast base rebuilding, early convoy rescues, and quick skull/black box pickups</li>
    <li>Mid-campaign pivots to Arcadia, where the pace spikes and defensive pressure becomes constant</li>
    <li>The Shield World arc introduces sustained Flood combat, multi-faction fights, and larger base networks</li>
    <li>The finale ends with Spirit of Fire repairs and Forge's sacrifice to finish the campaign</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-10 text-cyan-300">Mission Highlights</h2>

  <!-- Mission 1-2: Harvest -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 1-2: Harvest</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Establish Alpha Base quickly—buildings construct at 10x speed during the tutorial phase</li>
    <li>The first black box is under a bridge near the starting area</li>
    <li>First skull triggers after killing a specific Grunt camp</li>
    <li>Warthogs and Marines carry early pressure; dodge Grunt grenades to keep Forge's Warthog alive</li>
    <li>Destroying the methane refineries takes out the enemy air pads, reducing base harassment</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 3: Relic Interior -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 3: Relic Interior</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Very short mission that can be speedrun in about five minutes once collectibles are secured</li>
    <li>Enemies spawn infinitely from doors—you can farm veterancy here if you want to min-max</li>
    <li>Keep a Marine squad stationed to grab the skull when it spawns; don't "all units" move or you'll pull them away</li>
    <li>Grizzly tanks with two or three stars become extremely effective at destroying Hunters</li>
    <li>The black box is outside the main structure, guarded by Jackals</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 4: Arcadia City -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 4: Arcadia City (Hardest Mission)</h3>
  <div class="bg-gray-800/50 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">
      <strong class="text-cyan-400">The most difficult mission in the campaign.</strong> Many players fail because they try to protect civilians instead of cargo pods.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-300 space-y-1">
      <li>You only need <strong class="text-cyan-400">ONE cargo pod</strong> to survive—the mission is about protecting pods, not civilians</li>
      <li>Ignore the third cargo pod on the far side; it will fly off regardless</li>
      <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Hornets are the best unit composition</strong> because the two biggest threats (Hunters and Locusts) can't attack air</li>
      <li>Don't stress about the 500 civilian or 50 elite kill objectives—they happen naturally while defending</li>
      <li>Let Covenant attack civilians to buy time for your cargo pods; this is counterintuitive but effective</li>
      <li>Skull spawns after killing 50 Elites, appears near where three walkways converge</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Mission 5: Arcadia Outskirts -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 5: Arcadia Outskirts</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>The Mega Turret will one-shot your units; approach carefully</li>
    <li>Black box is near the far eastern reactor</li>
    <li>Skull requires killing 5 Wraiths—don't hijack them or the kills won't count</li>
    <li>Spartans can hijack enemy vehicles, which is useful but conflicts with the skull objective</li>
    <li>Station units inside reactors to gain bonus power income</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 6: Dome of Light -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 6: Dome of Light</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Kill 50 Banshees for the skull, which spawns in the back of the warehouse area</li>
    <li>Station the Spartan with the laser in a garrison tower for easy achievement progress</li>
    <li>Wolverines and turrets are essential for the constant air drops</li>
    <li>The first major wave hits hard—have a definitive defensive force ready before pushing</li>
    <li>Upgrade to Wingman and Chaff for Hornets; these upgrades are more impactful in HW1 than HW2</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 7: Scarab -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 7: Scarab</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Destroy conduit towers to slow the Scarab's advance</li>
    <li>After 10 conduits, the skull and black box spawn together</li>
    <li>Start with Warthogs for mobility, then pivot to Scorpions and Cobras</li>
    <li>Rhinos underperform here compared to other options</li>
    <li>Cobras can cheese bases from outside turret range by attacking from elevated positions</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 8-9: Shield World -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 8-9: Shield World</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Flood pressure ramps up significantly; missile turrets are recommended against swarms</li>
    <li>Dormant Flood structures can be permanently destroyed during Cleansing waves</li>
    <li>Cleansing waves periodically sweep the map—fly away from them to survive</li>
    <li>The skull requires killing 20 Flood Stalks; sweep the map systematically</li>
    <li>Wolverines are essential for dealing with the constant flying Flood forms</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 10: Shield World (Continued) -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 10: Shield World (Continued)</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Kill 350 Flood Swarms for the skull—this is the most time-consuming objective</li>
    <li>Gremlins (unique unit) are underrated; they chain-stun enemies and can lock down entire groups</li>
    <li>Black box is due north of the base hangar, but you need Hornets to reach it</li>
    <li>Station Wolverines at the corners of the Spirit of Fire to catch Flood on flyby patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 11: Reactor Defense -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 11: Reactor Defense</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Reactor defense is a hard fail condition—if the reactor dies, you lose</li>
    <li>The skull requires killing 10 Bomber forms; Vultures are recommended</li>
    <li>You can hijack Locusts to cheese Covenant bases from outside turret range</li>
    <li>There's a spot on a rock where a Locust can sit safely and farm kills indefinitely</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Mission 12: Repairs -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission 12: Repairs</h3>
  <div class="bg-gray-800/50 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">
      <strong class="text-cyan-400">Shortest mission in the campaign</strong>—can be completed in 2-3 minutes on lower difficulties.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-300 space-y-1">
      <li>Protect the Spirit of Fire engine with Cyclops, Wolverines, and turrets</li>
      <li>The skull requires destroying 12 Spirit transport ships before they land</li>
      <li>Black box is at the front end of the ship (northeast), near where Captain Cutter's name appears</li>
      <li>Drop heals on the power core to speed up repairs</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Skulls and Black Boxes</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">How They Work</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Black boxes work like skulls in FPS Halo games—hidden collectibles in specific locations</li>
    <li>Skulls are unlocked by accomplishing something (killing specific enemies, hitting kill counts)</li>
    <li>Flying units can pick up both skulls and black boxes</li>
    <li>The game can get buggy with skull spawns; sometimes you'll miss one due to pathing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Mission-Specific Locations</h3>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Harvest Missions:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Black box is under a bridge near the starting area</li>
    <li>Skull triggers after clearing a specific Grunt camp</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Relic Interior:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Keep Marines stationed where the skull will spawn; don't use "all units" or you'll miss it</li>
    <li>Black box is outside, guarded by Jackals</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Arcadia City:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Skull spawns after killing 50 Elites, near where three walkways converge</li>
    <li>You can pick it up with flying units</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Arcadia Outskirts:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Skull requires killing 5 Wraiths (hijacked kills don't count)</li>
    <li>Black box is by the far eastern reactor</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Dome of Light:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Kill 50 Banshees for the skull</li>
    <li>The third reactor position can only be reached by Pelican drop—black box is there</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Shield World Missions:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>One skull requires 750 Flood kills—by far the most painful objective</li>
    <li>Another requires killing 20 Flood Stalks—sweep the map systematically</li>
    <li>Black boxes are often at the edge of the map or near hangar doors</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Repairs:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Skull requires destroying 12 Spirit transport ships before they land</li>
    <li>Black box is at the front end of the ship near Captain Cutter's nameplate</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Legendary Co-op Tips</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Role Distribution</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Split roles: one player holds base defense and economy while the other pushes objectives</li>
    <li>Transfer units constantly to balance power spikes and keep both fronts active</li>
    <li>In co-op, both players can build on shared bases—coordinate who upgrades what</li>
    <li>Set rally points for your partner when making units for them</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Economy and Defense</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Build turrets early on missions with repeat air drops—missile turrets specifically for Flood swarms</li>
    <li>Pocket your Heals—you can drop them on cargo pods that aren't under attack to repair them</li>
    <li>On missions with multiple bases, controlling power reactors is critical for tech upgrades</li>
    <li>Garrison Marines in reactors for bonus income</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Combat Tactics</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Wolverines and Hawks/Vultures handle air threats and Scarabs far more safely than ground pushes</li>
    <li>Park a unit on critical objectives (reactors, control points, conduits) to avoid soft locks and unlock upgrades faster</li>
    <li>Don't use "all units" commands carelessly—you'll accidentally pull defenders away from objectives</li>
    <li>Use local units selection when you need to move only nearby troops</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Unit Management</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Right trigger lets you micro individual units when you have "all units" selected</li>
    <li>You can hijack enemy vehicles with Spartans, but killed enemies won't count for skull objectives</li>
    <li>Flying units can pick up skulls and black boxes</li>
    <li>Warthogs can revive downed Spartans quickly—sacrifice a Warthog to res your heroes if needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Unit and Tech Priorities</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 ml-4">
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Early game:</strong> Marines, Warthogs, and Flamers for map control and early pickups</li>
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Midgame:</strong> Scorpions, Wolverines, and Hawks for flexible responses to Hunters and air</li>
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Late game:</strong> Vultures and MAC upgrades for Scarabs, backed by tech-upgraded bases</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Specific Unit Notes</h3>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Scorpions vs Grizzlies:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Power Turret Scorpions with Spartans inside are the GG army composition</li>
    <li>In HW1, Grizzlies have a much weaker Canister Shell compared to Scorpions</li>
    <li>This is different from HW2 where the Grizzly has different pop costs</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Hornets:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Best unit for Arcadia City because Hunters and Locusts can't attack air</li>
    <li>Wingman upgrade is huge—more impactful than in HW2</li>
    <li>Chaff Pod upgrade helps survivability significantly</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Cobras:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Can attack bases from outside turret range when positioned on high ground</li>
    <li>Excellent for "cheesing" enemy bases safely</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Locusts (Hijacked):</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>If placed on certain rocks, they can sit safely and rack up kills</li>
    <li>Use them to destroy bases from long range without taking return fire</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Flamers:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Essential against infantry-heavy Flood sections</li>
    <li>Fully upgraded Flamers slaughter most ground threats</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Wolverines:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Critical for any mission with heavy air presence</li>
    <li>Station them at base corners to intercept flying enemies on approach</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Gremlins:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Underrated unique unit with chain-stun ability</li>
    <li>Can lock down entire enemy groups; no one used them in multiplayer but they were powerful</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-2"><strong class="text-cyan-400">Spartans:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Can hijack enemy vehicles, giving you instant combat power</li>
    <li>Put Spartans inside Scorpions for the ultimate late-game combo</li>
    <li>Jerome with the Spartan Laser should be garrisoned in towers for achievement progress</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Veterancy and Upgrade Mechanics</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Veterancy System</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Units gain stars (veterancy) by killing enemies—stars are more impactful in HW1 than HW2</li>
    <li>A two-star Grizzly noticeably outperforms an unvetted one</li>
    <li>You can farm veterancy by letting enemies spawn infinitely from doors (Relic Interior mission)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Upgrade Philosophy</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>HW1 has more unit upgrades than HW2, where most units only have one upgrade</li>
    <li>Rush to T3/T4 when possible for Wingman, Canister Shell, and similar game-changing upgrades</li>
    <li>ODST upgrades require specific tech levels to unlock</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Leader Powers</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Anders can heal vehicles with her ability</li>
    <li>Cryo Bomb destroys air units effectively—save it for swarm situations</li>
    <li>MAC Blast is your answer to Scarabs and heavily fortified positions</li>
    <li>Carpet Bomb is useful for clearing grouped enemies but less precise</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Story and Character Notes</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Sergeant Forge:</strong> A man with a shotgun on a mission; his relationship with Anders provides emotional stakes</li>
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Professor Anders:</strong> Her abduction drives the Shield World plot</li>
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Serena (AI):</strong> Has attitude; her line about "so we can all die together" captures the desperate tone</li>
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Red Team Spartans:</strong> Jerome, Alice, and Douglas—all referenced in Halo Wars 2</li>
    <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Captain Cutter:</strong> His name appears on the Spirit of Fire during the finale mission</li>
    <li>Forge is brought back as a leader in Halo Wars 2 in his Warthog, honoring how players remember him</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6 text-cyan-200">Lore Details</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>The campaign ends with the Spirit of Fire going into cryosleep and becoming "lost with all hands" for 28 years</li>
    <li>This explains why the UNSC in Halo 1 doesn't know about the Flood—the Spirit of Fire crew couldn't report back</li>
    <li>The multiplayer Rebel bases tie into the lore that Spartans were originally made for the insurrection</li>
  </ul>
