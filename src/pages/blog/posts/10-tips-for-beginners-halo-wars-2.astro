    These are 10 tips for players who have just picked up Halo Wars 2 or want to dive into multiplayer. Many new players jump straight into multiplayer and get overwhelmed by all the options, upgrades, and dynamics. Following these tips can help you become more successful in your matches.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-cyan-300">Tip 1: Complete the In-Game Tutorial First</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">Before jumping online, complete both the basic and advanced tutorials. They're extremely helpful for understanding:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>How units work</li>
    <li>How upgrades work</li>
    <li>Unit dynamics and counters</li>
    <li>How your economy functions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 2: Always Start with a Supply Pad</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">Many new players start with a generator first, then train Marines or Jackrabbits, and run out of supplies with no way to generate more.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">What happens:</strong> You can't build anything - no buildings, no upgrades, no units. You're stuck waiting for a teammate to send you supplies.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Solution:</strong> Always build a supply pad first to get your economy rolling.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 3: Upgrade Your Supply Pads and Generators</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">Upgrades cost:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Supply Pads: 200 power</li>
    <li>Generators: 300 power</li>
    <li>Same cost for both UNSC and Banished</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">Some leaders have cheaper upgrades (like Forge's Rolling Economy).</p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Why it's worth it:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Generator income improves dramatically when upgraded</li>
    <li>Supply pad rate of return decreases with more pads, but upgrading is still worth it</li>
    <li>Always upgrade your generators</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 4: Take Your Mini Bases</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">Mini bases cost:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>200 supplies (1-slot)</li>
    <li>300 supplies (2-slot)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Why they matter:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Use slots for supply pads, production buildings, War Council, or Armory</li>
    <li>If enemies take them, they gain economy while you waste time destroying the base</li>
    <li>Enemies can use them for production buildings right on your side of the map for sneak attacks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 5: Control Power Nodes</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">Power nodes provide:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Line of sight</li>
    <li>Constant free power income throughout the match</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">The math:</strong> A slow trickle from one node multiplied by 4-5 nodes becomes significant. With just 2 generators and 3 power nodes, you'll have good power income for upgrades and advanced units.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 6: Spend Leader Points Immediately</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">When you get a leader point, spend it right away. With 16 leaders and different playstyles, specific recommendations vary by leader (check individual leader guides).</p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">General advice:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>You can't go wrong with most leader point options</li>
    <li>Consider your playstyle: Do you want a passive ability (like Colony's Combat Repair) or an active one (like Glassing Beam)?</li>
    <li>Good offensive powers can be game-changers</li>
    <li>Good passive powers can save you</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 7: Immediately Upgrade Expansion Bases</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">When you expand (usually around Tech 2), upgrade your expansion base as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Cost:</strong> About 400 power (varies by leader)
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Benefits:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Two more building slots</li>
    <li>Four turret slots (critical for protection)</li>
    <li>More base health</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 8: Build Turrets and Shield Generators</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Turrets:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Build 1-2 turrets early to discourage rushes</li>
    <li>Even one turret can stop an early attack</li>
    <li>Build on all four turret slots when you have resources</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Shield Generators (Banished):</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Every Banished base should have at least one shield generator</li>
    <li>Also consider one cloaking generator</li>
    <li>Shield generators absorb massive damage (can stop Vulture spam attacks)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 9: Never Build Generators on Mini Bases</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Why this is bad:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Mini bases have much less health than main bases</li>
    <li>Generator costs increase with each one built (2nd costs more than 1st, 3rd costs more than 2nd)</li>
    <li>By your 3rd-4th generator, you're spending 800-1,100 supplies</li>
    <li>Putting an expensive generator on a low-health, undefended mini base is an easy target for enemies to cripple your economy</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Exceptions:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Mini bases far in the back (like on Ashes or Sentry corners)</li>
    <li>Johnson with Digging In Deep (all buildings are free)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Tip 10: Keep an Eye on Your Units</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">The problem:</strong> While focusing on your base for upgrades or building placement, enemies can:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>Sneak attack with cloaked units</li>
    <li>Pelican transport units to your army</li>
    <li>Drop offensive leader powers (Glassing Beam, Inferno, Cryo Bomb)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">The consequence:</strong> Your entire army gets wiped, you spend resources and time rebuilding, and opponents push straight for your base.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong class="text-cyan-400">Solution:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
    <li>You don't need to stare at your units constantly</li>
    <li>Keep an eye on the mini-map</li>
    <li>Watch for enemy approaches or Pelican drops</li>
    <li>React quickly to threats</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8 text-cyan-300">Summary</h2>
