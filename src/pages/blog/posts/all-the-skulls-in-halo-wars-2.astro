  <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Skulls</strong> are game modifiers featured in Halo Wars 2. When unlocked and activated they can alter gameplay difficulty and add interesting features to your campaign experience. There are fifteen skulls in total, each awarded for completing specific objectives throughout the campaign missions.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mb-4">How to Find Skulls</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Skulls are awarded for completing specific Primary Objectives, Optional Objectives, or unmarked tasks throughout all of the missions in the game with the exception of the Prologue, The Signal. Each skull requires specific conditions to be met, often requiring you to complete optional objectives before or during the main mission progression.

Once your entire squadron reaches the comms building, move your Hellbringers and Warthogs behind the building. Now move Alice and one Cyclops into one of the two garrisons in front of the building and move the other two Cyclops into the other garrison. Hold out like this until extraction arrives, making sure none of the Cyclops or Units behind the building die. It is okay to lose a few units, but do not lose a whole squad.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-400"><strong>Strategy:</strong> The best method to employ for this task is to have Alice either hijack a Wraith on the beach or take control of the Scorpion tank on the beach (either works). Make sure Alice is your primary focus throughout the mission; heal her when needed and make sure she doesn't take the brunt of the enemy's attacks. When the Scarab shows up at the end of the mission, you should already have a sizable army of Anti-Tanks (Cyclops and Scorpions) to accompany Alice in taking it down quickly. It's better to have a Nightingale accompany Alice most of the time, to save resources from using Restoration Drones. In addition, you can also do it in conjunction with hijacking a Locust as part of the Bonus Objective and it has more range to allow Alice to build up veterancy without taking too much hits.</p>

      <div class="bg-gray-900/50 rounded p-4">
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-400"><strong>Strategy:</strong> In this mission, you will need to protect the western and eastern barricades; the former of which is just to the left of your base and the latter of which is a little southeast of your base. The best way to ensure they aren't overwhelmed and destroyed is to build one Anti-Infantry and one Anti-Vehicle turret at each barricade and then place at least three or four Hornets and one Nightingale just ahead of the barricade as the "first line of defense." It's recommended to try doing this on a low difficulty, as the enemy forces become increasingly difficult to keep at bay past the fifteen minute mark. Alternately, create a kill zone with mixed anti-tanks and infantries (Recommended group of Full Upgrade Marines, Cyclops, and Nightingales) for better efficiency. In addition, two siege turrets and two anti-air turrets should be built on the base for defense support.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-400"><strong>Strategy:</strong> You will come into contact with the first Warlord by moving your Units past the first base you build and down the ridge to the Banished's base during Jerome and Allieri's segment. Provided you stick to the right-hand side of the valley/map once you are in Alice's segment of the mission, you will encounter the second Warlord on your way to the first Kodiak deployment position. The last Warlord can be confronted by continuing to travel north on this eastern edge of the valley; once you reach the second red energy barrier, he will attack you. While the Warlords have a large amount of health, Sniper can do the job best since they can take out the Warlords without taking any hits and from long distances.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-400"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Keeping the Scarab alive through the mission shouldn't be too much of an issue if you're playing on one of the lower difficulties. If you're playing on Heroic or Legendary, though, make sure the Scarab stays at the rear of your squad so it doesn't take too much damage. Move slowly at all times and be smart as to when it's necessary to retreat and heal your Units. Always bring Nightingales to keep the Scarab constantly healed at all times. Have a mix of Kodiak, Snipers, and Wolverines for ground and anti-air support.</p>

To start, make sure to build and upgrades turrets around the edges of the central chamber. Focus on building Anti-Infantry and Anti-Vehicle turrets. Next, you'll want to make sure each of the four entryways of the chamber are appropriately defended. Split your focuses intelligently; you'll have access to Hellbringers, Snipers, Spartans, Nightingales, Warthogs, Wolverines, Scorpions...you name it. Spread them out evenly and make use of your Leader Powers as often as possible. Always drop ODSTs every time a leader power is ready, since you get an endless population to strengthen defenses further.</p>

Once you have a sizable and formidable squadron of mixed units (Snipers, Spartans, Scorpions, Cyclopses, etc.), storm each Warlord's position to take them and their reinforcements out. Try to complete it in less than ten minutes after the mission starts, or the first batch of reinforcements arrived (8 Marines and 8 Cyclops), since the more time you take, the heavier the Banished's attack will get, and you have less of a chance to defeat the Warlords. Use every Leader Power if possible, as you'll need more numbers to defend the Control Room.</p>
